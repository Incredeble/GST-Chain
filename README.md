# GST-Chain prototype

<br/>
<br/>
We seen that in most of the transactions third party involves (paytm , credit card , debit
card , etc. ) due to which transaction time increase , and they also increase some amount
as fee. In Blockchain technology no third party is involved as transaction can be done
between peer to peer and it makes transaction fast and secure as they involves smart
contract. All the transaction are transparent ,
<br/>
<br>
● GST HAS INTENSE DATA COLLECTION AS IT IS AN INDIRECT TAX I.E. NOT LIEVED DIRECTLY TO THE INCOME OF INDIVIDUAL.<br/>
● BLOCKCHAIN IS AN IDEAL WAY TO HANDLE SUCH COMPLEX AND INTENSE DATA.<br/>
● THE TRANSACTION WILL BE DONE IN REAL TIME AND SYSETM WILL BE TRANSPARENT AND SECURE.
